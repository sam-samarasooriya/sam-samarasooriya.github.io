      <strong><u>JavaScript Fundamentals</u></strong>
    </h1>

        <h2><u>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</u></h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript (aka JS) is one of the most famous programming languages in
          the world. JS was introduced in 1995 and had significant growth and is
          now commonly used in web pages and apps in the present world.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript language is a high-level, versatile programming language
          mainly used for creating interactive and dynamic features on websites.
          It allows developers to add or modify the content and behaviour of web
          pages in real-time with enhancing the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As discussed in previous blog posts, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
          provides the structure and content of a web page, such as text,
          images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the
          presentation, including layout, colours, and fonts. JavaScript ties it
          all together by adding interactivity. For example, while HTML defines
          a button and CSS styles it, JavaScript can control what happens when
          the button is clicked, such as showing a popup or changing content on
          the page.

          <u>Description of Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Control flow determines the order in which statements are executed in
          a program. It includes
        </p>

        <h4>Control Flow</h4>
        <p>
          Control flow determines the order in which statements are executed in
          a program. It includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Conditional Statements: Direct execution based on conditions (e.g.,
            if, else, switch).
          </li>
          <li>
            Branching Statements: Alter the flow of execution (e.g., return,
            break, continue).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Loops</h4>
        <p>Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            for Loop: Executes code a specific number of times (e.g., iterating
            through a range).
          </li>
          <li>while Loop: Repeats code while a condition is true.</li>
          <li>
            do...while Loop: Similar to while, but guarantees at least one
            execution of the code.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Arrays</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays are ordered collections of elements, usually of the same type,
          indexed by numbers:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Creation: Defined with square brackets (e.g., let fruits = ['apple',
            'banana']).
          </li>
          <li>
            Access: Elements are accessed by their index (e.g., fruits[0]).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Objects are collections of key-value pairs used to represent more
          complex data structures:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Creation: Defined with curly braces (e.g., let person = { name:
            'John', age: 30 }).
          </li>
          <li>
            Access: Properties are accessed using dot or bracket notation (e.g.,
            person.name or person['age']).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These concepts are fundamental to controlling the flow of execution
          and organizing data in programming.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h2><u>Functions and why they are useful</u></h2>
        <p>
          Functions are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific
          task. They help modularize and organize code by allowing you to
          encapsulate logic into discrete units
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>Why Functions are Useful</p>
          <li>
            Reusability: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times,
            reducing code duplication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modularity: Functions help break down complex problems into smaller,
            manageable pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maintainability: Encapsulating functionality in functions makes code
            easier to update and debug.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide implementation details and
            expose only necessary interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organization: They help in structuring code logically, improving
            readability and collaboration.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <h2><u>The DOM and DevTools</u></h2>

        <h4>The DOM (Document Object Model)</h4>
        <p>
          The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents
          the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, where each node
          corresponds to an element or attribute in the document.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Structure: The DOM maps HTML elements to objects that can be
            manipulated using JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with the DOM to modify the
            content, structure, or style of a webpage dynamically
          </li>
          <li>
            Events: The DOM allows you to handle user interactions (e.g.,
            clicks, input) by attaching event listeners to elements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>DevTools (Developer Tools)</h4>
        <p>
          DevTools are a set of tools built into web browsers that help
          developers inspect, debug, and optimize web pages. Key features
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Elements Panel: View and modify the HTML and CSS of a webpage in
            real-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Console: Log messages, run JavaScript code, and view errors and
            warnings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Network Panel: Monitor network requests, view loading times, and
            debug API calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sources Panel: Debug JavaScript code, set breakpoints, and step
            through code execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance Panel: Analyze and optimize page performance by
            profiling runtime behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Application Panel: Inspect and manage web storage, cookies, and
            service workers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
