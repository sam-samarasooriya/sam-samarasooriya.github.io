    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>

    <H1>What does this mean?</H1>
    
        <P>Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori health model developed by leading Māori health advocate Sir Mason Durie in 1984. Te Whare Tapa Whā shows us our wellbeing in four dimensions, and while it provides a Māori perspective on health,
         there is something in it for everyone, no matter who you are or where you are from. Te Whare Tapa Whā describes wellbeing as a wharenui or meeting house. The four walls of the wharenui represent the four dimensions of your holistic wellbeing.</P>
