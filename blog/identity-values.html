  <H1><b>Identity and Values</b></H1>
  <p>Kia Ora Guys, As you already know, I am Sam and I was born and grew up in Colombo, Sri Lanka. ( Unfortunately, some people do not know Sri Lanka, Check it out, It is a beautiful tropical country. ) And I living in New Zealand for close to 09 years and this is my second home. I have done my tertiary studies in the Business Management stream in Auckland and worked in the travel industry and Retail as well.</p>
  <p>I can introduce myself as a supportive person who likes to help others. And I am good with teamwork which I improved from my work experience. And hope to add new value along the life journey ahead.  In terms of identity, Iam a Sri Lankan Sinhalese ( my ethnicity)  who follows Buddhism.  Also, I am a very ethical and sensitive human being.</p>  
  <p>I/ had a great passion towards to IT since my school days but my life took me on a different path at that time. Now I found the opportunity to follow my passion and I hope I will be successful. After doing my research, I found DEV ACADEMY and wanted to start the boot camp programme. And the good motivation was Dev Academy welcomes anyone with a passion for the program regardless of their IT knowledge.</p> 
  <p>Hence, hope these 17 weeks will be a turning point in my life and look forward to working with the awesome ROA 2024 team.</p>
