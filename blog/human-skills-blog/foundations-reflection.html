    <h1><u>Human Skills Reflection</u></h1>

    <P> Below Questions and Answers represent overall Human Skills learned throughout the Foundation Preiod with Dev Academy. </P>

    <Ol>
      <li><H3><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong></H3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>How to improve my productivity </li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Curiosity</li>
      </ul>
      
      <br>

      <li><h3><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></h3></li>
      <p>Values, empathy and self-awareness play an essential role in learning and programming—these influence how a person behaves in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Values</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><p><u>Ethical considerations:</u> Programmers are guided by values to develop software that respects privacy, encourages diversity, and stays safe. In today's AI and IT ecosystem, ethical standards like fairness, transparency, and security are essential.</p></li>
            <li><p><u>Motivation and purpose:</u>Powerful moral convictions can stimulate inner drive, encouraging students and programmers to persevere through difficult assignments because they see the worth of their actions.</p></li>
          </ul>

        <br>
        
        <li><strong>Empathy</strong></li>
        <p>Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, plays a vital role in programming and learning because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><u>User-centred design:</u>In programming, empathy helps developers design products that meet the needs of diverse users. Programmers can build solutions that are more inclusive, accessible, and straightforward by taking into account the views of users.</p></li>
          <li><p><u>Collaboration and teamwork:</u>Empathy fosters effective communication within teams. Being able to see things from a colleague's viewpoint helps resolve conflicts and ensures smoother cooperation, especially in cross-functional teams with different expertise.</p></li>
        </ul>
    
        <br>

        <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong></li>
        <p>Self-awareness, or the understanding of one’s strengths, weaknesses, and biases, is crucial for both personal growth and effective programming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><u>Growth mindset:</u>A growth mindset that welcomes problems as teaching opportunities is fostered by self-awareness, which assists students in identifying areas in which they need to improve. It encourages more introspective practice and ongoing skill improvement.</p></li>
          <li><p><u>Adaptability:</u>Self-aware programmers and learners are more flexible because they can evaluate their development objectively, admit when they need assistance, and change course when called for. In fields as dynamic as technology, where new tools and paradigms are continually emerging, this adaptability is essential.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
      </ul>
      
      <br>

      <li><h3><strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong></h3></li>
      <p>That would be Emotional Intelligence (EQ). The EQ has a greater impact on leadership, teamwork, and learning than was previously thought. People with high emotional intelligence (EQ) can control their emotions, empathise with others, and traverse social difficulties.</p>
      <p>As a result, they are often very good at solving problems in teams, resolving conflicts, and even addressing technical problems. In my experience, EQ frequently triumphs over technical expertise in terms of team leadership and influence.</p>
    
      <br>

      <li><h3><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</strong></h3></li>
      <p>Self-awareness and Overcoming Biases can be introduced as one of the challenges when learning Human Skills. The most difficult aspects of human skills learning are developing genuine self-awareness and recognizing unconscious biases. Many people find it difficult to face deeply rooted habits and beliefs or to evaluate their strengths and faults objectively.</p>
      <p>Be they cognitive or emotional, biases can be subtle, and it takes careful thought, input from others, and a commitment to change to learn how to recognise and lessen them.</p>

      <br>

      <li><h3><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong></h3></li>
      <p>In short, Dev Academy’s goal is to produce the best developer who studies code and the people. Learning Human Skills</p>

      <br>

      <li><h3><strong>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></h3></li>
      <p>Learning Human Skills while studying to become a developer is essential.  Human Skills teach a person how to deal with internal and external factors. Software development is often a team-based effort, requiring close collaboration with other developers, designers, testers, project managers, and clients. Human skills such as communication, empathy, and teamwork are crucial.</p>
      <p>And technical skills provide the foundation for problem-solving, and human skills like critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability are equally important. The software development process often involves tight deadlines, complex projects, and changing requirements, leading to high-pressure situations. Hence, learning Human Skills such as stress management and resilience are important. In addition, Learning ethical decisions is also vital for a developer.</p>
