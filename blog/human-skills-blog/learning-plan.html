  <h2><u>Foundation Leaning Plan - Updated on 06th September 2024.</u></h2>

      <H3><b>My Long-Term GOAL in my career</b></H3>
          <p>Currently, I am studying with DEV Academy aiming to become a Skilled and Ethical Developer.
          I have been working in different industries and wanted a career change.  After some research in the industry, decided to become a developer.</p>
      
      <br>

      <H3><b>Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</b></H3>
          <p>I believe that learning style is unique to every person.  if I consider the standard learning methods, I mostly use the Visual learning style as I am good at retaining information when it is presented in many visual ways. However, learning a new subject is always a challenge for me as I always want to understand it fully. Since I am coming back to study after a long time, I find it more challenging.</p>
          <p>However, my deep passion for becoming a developer pushes me to keep working on this boot camp. I believe that passion and pushing myself to stay focused are my strengths. Also, I'm using my analytical skills and problem-solving skills to become successful in this boot camp.</p>
          <p>When think about my limitations, I find myself getting distracted by other things sometimes and I find that affects my learning with the boot camp. And I think this is due to coming back for studies after a long period. And my limited or zero knowledge of programming languages could limit my ability to learn them quickly.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I trying my very best to overcome my limitations and be successful in this crash course.</p>
      
      <br>

      <h3><b>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></h3>
          <p>I would love to improve my “People Skills” as I will meet new team members in different age groups, ethnicities and cultures. Since this is a new learning area and a different teaching style ( Bootcamp Structure ) for me, I am a bit behind in my “Time Management”. Hence, it is another personal goal for me.
            And the web development requires good “Creativity” to provide great outcomes.  In addition, I would like to improve my “Critical Thinking skills”. Furthermore, when thinking about getting into my target job market such as the Tech Industry, “Networking” is more important.  End of this course, we are scheduled for a Career-related session and hope it will improve my Networking Skills. </p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</b></h3>
          <p>I always try to plan the day as a good start. And it has helped me many times in many tasks. I always try to stay longer if needed aiming to complete the tasks that I set for the day. Since this foundation is remote learning, any learner including me may get distracted due to some factors. So I do visit the Library for studies sometimes to avoid more distractions.  Also, I always try to communicate friendly and safe with my colleagues. And try to reach out to the facilitators when require support when stuck at some points. And their support is awesome.</p>
    
      <br>

      <h3><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b></h3>
          <p>If I am behind the my workload, I will go out of my comfort zone and may work the whole day if required. And, I do not forget the ask for help from my wahanu and facilitators.</p>

      <br>

      <h3><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</b></h3>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, the facilitator for our cohort is always there during the week. At this stage, Dave is our facilitator and I think he is doing his role at his best. Their engagement can easily be noticed via Discord Channel which has been set up nicely to reach each other students and facilitators as well.</p>
