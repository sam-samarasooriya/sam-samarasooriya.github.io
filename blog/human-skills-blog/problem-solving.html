    <h3><u>What is Problem Solving</u></h3>
      <p>Problem solving is the process of identifying a challenge or obstacle and finding a solution to overcome it. It involves several steps:</p>
      <ul><li>Defining the problem,</li>
          <li>Defining the problem</li>
          <li>Analyzing the situation</li>
          <li>Brainstorming potential solutions</li>
          <li>evaluating options</li>
          <li>implementing the best solution</li>
      </ul>
    
  <h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
  <p>Below are questions and answers that reflect how the Problem-Solving method can be applied in real-life situations.</p>

<ol>
  <li><h4> A time you blocked on a simple problem:</h4></li>
     <P><u>What was the problem?</u></P>
     <p>-  I tried to add an image to my blog page, but I missed a few entries when adding the image.</P>

    <p><u>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</u></p>
    <p>	- I did a good review of the code I typed in the file and broke it down. Then I found that I had missed some steps when entering the codes.</p>

    <p><u>How did you feel throughout the process?</u></p>
    <p>- Initially, I felt frustrated, but everything was cleared after checking the codes slowly.</p>

    <p><u>What did you learn?</u></p>
    <p>- It is better to take a step back and relax your mind and review things slowly.</p>

<br>

<li><h4> A moment when I elegantly solved a problem.</h4></li>

    <p><u>What was the problem?</u></p>
    <p>- I was trying to set up my computer for the first time for my studies and I was confused.</p>

    <p><u>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</u></p>
    <p>- I reviewed the instructions by taking time and followed the process step by step.</p>

    <p><u>How did you feel throughout the process?</u></p>
    <p>- I was a bit disappointed in the beginning, but felt proud once I completed all the steps.</p>

    <p><u>What did you learn?</u></p>
    <p>- You should not rush when you are trying new things first. Need patience and a relaxed mind.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>A brief reflection on how  confident I felt when using below problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4></li>

    <p><u>Pseudocode:</u></p>
    <p>-Pseudocode are the comments that you add to the coding system. This helps to plan a complex code with easy steps. And this will help other users when they read your pseudocodes.</p>

    <p><u>Trying something</u></p>
    <p>- This is like learning new skills, such as learning how to play a guitar. But this requires some focus and time.</p>

    <p><u>Rubber ducky method</u></p>
    <p>- This makes a developer explain to a non-living object. Then, it helps you to figure out the problem. And I have used this many times even for non-technical problems.</p>

    <p><u>Reading error messages</u></p>
    <p>- This method taught me to split the problems (codes) into small sections and review each of them.</p>
    <p>Then you will identify issues. And I have comfortably used this method for some issues that I came across.</p>

    <p><u>Console.logging</u></p>
    <p>- This helped me to check my code results. And this is super handy and I have used this very often.</p>

    <p><u>Googling</u></p>
    <p>- I treat Google as a library as it includes data and information in every subject. Hence, using Google was a great support for solving issues.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>Reflect on a time when I was reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h4></li>
      <p>I mostly try my very best to resolve issues using the above-mentioned methods. However, there were a few moments when I felt that I needed some guidance.</p>
      <p>Most of the time, I took a step back and did not ask for help, thinking that I would find a solution. And I did for many.</p>
      <p>However, I felt too shy to ask for help as I thought that others would think that I was behind other team members.</p>
